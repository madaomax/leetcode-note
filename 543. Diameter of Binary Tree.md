# [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/)

Easy (But I think should be medium, requires solid understanding of BST and DFS)



## Solution 1: official sol

Along with my renaming and comments for better clarity.
**Idea:** Note that the diameter is the left height + right height of a cur node. (Let's define a None node has height 0 and a leaf node has height of 1.)

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        """
        Given the root of a binary tree,
        Diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path
        between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not 
        pass through the root.
        The length of a path between two nodes is representted by the
        number of  edges between them.

        Returns:
            length of the diameter of the tree.
        
        Idea: Use DFS and find path for all nodes that pass through
         this node.
        DS:
        `res`: to store  
        Observation the longest path has to be between two leaf nodes.
        Proof by contradiction.
        Therefore, the maximum path that passes through a node =
        sum(max height of left subtree, max height of right tree) + 1

        Therefore, we'll just need to implement a recursive DFS function
        that visits every node and calculate its height, and update
        the diameter found along the way.

            Summary:
                Use height of subtrees to updates diameter, defined as the length of the longest path
                between any two nodes in a tree. The maximum diameter found 
                so far.
