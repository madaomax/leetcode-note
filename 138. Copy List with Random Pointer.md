# [138. Copy List with Random Pointer](https://leetcode.com/problems/copy-list-with-random-pointer/)

Linked List, copy, hashtable



## Solution 1: Hash Table for old->new node mapping.

```python
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not head:
            return None
        # key = old node, value = new node.
        old_to_new = {}
        
        # make all copies
        curr = head
        while curr:
            old_to_new[curr] = Node(curr.val)
            curr = curr.next
        
        # populate next and random field.
        curr = head
        while curr:
            old_to_new[curr].next = old_to_new.get(curr.next)
            old_to_new[curr].random = old_to_new.get(curr.random)
            curr = curr.next
            
        return old_to_new[head]
```



## Solution 2: Interleave old and new nodes.

In the original linked list, we can make use of the fact that LL has `next` pointers to store info, s.t. we don't need to create an auxiliary dictionary to keep track of 2N nodes. 

```python
class Solution:
    def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not head:
            return None
        
        curr = head
        # Create a new node right after each original node. Changing next pointer.
        while curr:
            new_node = Node(curr.val, curr.next)
            curr.next = new_node
            curr = new_node.next
        # Update copied nodes' random pointer to point to copied nodes.
        curr = head
        while curr:
            if curr.random:
                curr.next.random = curr.random.next
            curr = curr.next.next
        
        old_head = head
        new_head = head.next
        curr_old = old_head
        curr_new = new_head
        
        # Change the next pointers back so that these two LL are not intertwined.
        while curr_old:
            curr_old.next = curr_old.next.next
            curr_new.next = curr_new.next.next if curr_new.next else None
            curr_old = curr_old.next
            curr_new = curr_new.next
            
        return new_head
```
