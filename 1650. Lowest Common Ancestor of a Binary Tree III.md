## Solution 1: DFS + trace, my solution

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None
"""

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        """
        Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q,
        return their lowest common ancestor LCA.
        Each node will have a reference to its parent node.
        LCA is the lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree
        T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants.
        Args:
            p: Node
            q: Node
        Returns:
            (Node) LCA of p and q
        """

        # Search for p and q downstream.
        def dfs_findNode(root, node):
            if not root:
                return False
            if root == node:
                return True
            return dfs_findNode(root.left, node) or dfs_findNode(root.right, node)
        
        def trace(node, path):
            if not node.parent:
                return path
            return trace(node.parent, path + [node.parent])

        if dfs_findNode(p, q):
            return p
        if dfs_findNode(q, p):
            return q
        # Must be above p and q.
        parents_p = trace(p, [])
        parents_q = trace(q, [])
        for node in parents_p:
            if node in parents_q:
                return node
        return None

```

Idea: it's either p or q or above them both. 

Time complexity O(N) where N is the number of nodes in BST.

Space complexity O(N).





## Solution 2: Trace depth.

Make use of parent pointer. Find the first place where the two parents meet. 

```python
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = None
        self.right = None
        self.parent = None
"""

class Solution:
    def get_depth(self, p):
		# helper function to find the depth of the pointer in the tree
        depth = 0
        while p:
            p = p.parent
            depth += 1
        return depth
    
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, p: 'Node', q: 'Node') -> 'Node':
		# find the depth of each pointer
        p_depth = self.get_depth(p)
        q_depth = self.get_depth(q)
		
		# Move the lower pointer up so that they are each at the same level. 
		# For the smaller depth (p_depth < q_depth or q_depth < p_depth), 
		# the loop will be skipped and the pointer will stay at the same depth.
        for _ in range(p_depth - q_depth):
            p = p.parent
        for _ in range(q_depth - p_depth):
            q = q.parent
        
		# Now that they are at the same depth, move them up the tree in parallel until they meet
        while p != q:
            p=p.parent
            q=q.parent
        return p
```
