# [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Easy

Array, two pointers



Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

 

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?



## Solution 1ï¼šTwo pointers

Intuition: have one fast pointer to iterate through the entire array, and have 1 slow pointer to stay at where the leftmost zero is.



```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        slow = 0
        # this is the ptr for 0 index
        for fast in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[fast] != 0 and nums[slow] == 0:
                nums[slow], nums[fast] = nums[fast], nums[slow]
            # after swapped
            # we need slow pointer to be on a zero to get swapped.
            if nums[slow] != 0:
                slow += 1
        
```
