# [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

### Approach 1: Backtracking

We need every possible unique combination s.t. sum of the combination is equal to target. 

For such questions where we have to find "every possible" -> want to use backtrack.



Algorithm:

1. If the sum of the current combination is greater than target, then even if we move forward with this combination, the sum will only increase, so there is no fun to moving further with such a combination as we can never achieve the target sum from this. So backtrack from this. 
2. If the sum of the current combination is equal to the target, then we have a solution, so store this combination in the answers. Now moving forward with this combination also will only increase the sum and we can't achieve the target sum again from this ever. So backtrack from here. 
3. if we are here then that means the sum of the combination is still less that the target sum, and we have a scope of finding a combination whose sum can be equal to the target. 	
   1. i) Now consider all possible options into this combination, one at a time. 	
   2. ii) Go check if considering the current option can give us the solution. 	
   3. iii) Now when this option backtracks to this place again, now remove this option and try another option. e.g. at [2, 2, _ ] we have 3 options to fill the 3rd place i.e. [2, 3, 5]. 	So firstly we will go on with [2, 2, 2]. Then when this backtracks to this place again, remove the last 2 and try the next option which is 3 that means [2, 2, 3]. 	When this also backtracks remove 3 to try 5, that means [2, 2, 5]. 	Now as all the options are exhausted for [2, 2, _ ], now backtrack to its previous state which is [2, 2], and so on...

```Python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        res = []
        candidates.sort()
        self.dfs(candidates, target, 0, [], res)
        return res
        
    def dfs(self, nums, target, index, path, res):
        if target < 0:
            return # backtracking
        if target == 0:
            res.append(path)
            return
        for i in range(index, len(nums)):
            self.dfs(nums, target - nums[i], i, path+[nums[i]], res)
```

Approach 2:

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []
        helper = []
        self.findAns(0, target, candidates, ans, helper)
        return ans
    
    def findAns(self, index, target, arr, ans, helper):
        if index == len(arr):
            if target == 0:
                ans.append(helper[:])
            return
        
        if arr[index] <= target:
            helper.append(arr[index])
            self.findAns(index, target - arr[index], arr, ans, helper)
            helper.pop()
        
        self.findAns(index + 1, target, arr, ans, helper)
```

This has faster runtime than approach 1.
