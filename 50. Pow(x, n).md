# [50. Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)

Implement [pow(x, n)](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/valarray/pow/), which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., `xn`).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-100.0 < x < 100.0`
- `-231 <= n <= 231-1`
- `n` is an integer.
- Either `x` is not zero or `n > 0`.
- `-104 <= xn <= 104`



## Solution 1: square powering

Intuition: We can certainly naively multiply x by itself `n` times, but that gives us O(n) runtime. Can we do better by splitting the problem into half? 

Yes - we can do square each time s.t. we have O(logn) runtime.

```python
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        """
        Faster mypow: squaring!
        """
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        if n == 1:
            return x
        if n < 0:
            n = -n
            x = 1.0 / x
        if n % 2 != 0:
            return x * self.myPow(x * x, (n-1)/2)
        else:
            return self.myPow(x * x, n/2)
```

This is the recursive approach, can also do an iterative one.
