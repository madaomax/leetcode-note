# [155. Min Stack](https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/)

### Approach:

Since this question is just regular stack plus an extra operation for `getMin`, so we can just have an extra data structure to store the corresponding minimum element. The idea is that a minimum element added to the stack remains to be the minimum in the stack until a smaller element is pushed to the stack. Therefore, when we push an element to the `stack`, we also push the minimum element to the `minStack`. In this way, we can ensure that `pop` function executes correctly. 

```Python
class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.minStack = []
        

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.stack.append(val)
        if self.minStack:
            val = min(val, self.minStack)
        self.minStack.append(val)

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()
        self.minStack.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.minStack[-1]


# Your MinStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MinStack()
# obj.push(val)
# obj.pop()
# param_3 = obj.top()
# param_4 = obj.getMin()
```
