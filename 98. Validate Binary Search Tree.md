# [98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

### Approach 1: Inorder traversal 

Note that a valid BST defined in this question requires: the left ***subtree*** of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key; the right ***subtree*** of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key; both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

I was first tripped by this question because I thought we only need the left **node** and right **node** to be less than or greater than the current node. It should be the entire subtree. 

From the three restrictions, we know that a valid BST tree's leftmost child node must have the smallest value. If we do an in-order traversal of the BST (left child, parent, right child), the values for the visited nodes should be monotonically increasing. So now we have an idea for our algorithm.

General inorder tree traversal code looks like this:

```python
def printInorder(root):
	if root:
		# First recur on left child
		printInorder(root.left)
		# Then print the data of node
		print(root.val)
		# Then recur on right child
		printInorder(root.right)
```

And here is the annotated solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        """Given the root of a binary tree, detrmine if it is a valid BST."""
        prev = float('-inf')
        def inorder(node):
            # return T/F of whether tree rooted at node is a valid BST.
            nonlocal prev
            # Base case: None is a valid BST./We've gone past the leaf.
            if not node:
                return True
            # 1. inorder(node.left) recur / check if left subtree is validBST.
            # 2. check current node. 
            if not (inorder(node.left) and prev < node.val):
                return False
            prev = node.val
            # 3. inorder(node.right) recur / check if right subtree is validBST.
            return inorder(node.right)
        return inorder(root)
```
