# [1762. Buildings With an Ocean View](https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/)

Medium

stack



There are `n` buildings in a line. You are given an integer array `heights` of size `n` that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a **smaller** height.

Return a list of indices **(0-indexed)** of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= heights.length <= 105`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 109`



## Solution 1: intuitive

```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Summary:
            There are `n` buildings in a line.
            The ocean is to the right of the buildings.
            A building has an ocean view if all the buildings 
            to its right have a smaller height.
        Args:
            heights - int array of size n that represents the heights of the building in the
            line. 
        Returns:
            a list of indices (0-indexed) that have an ocean view,
            sorted in increasing order.
        Examples:
            [4,2,3,1]
        """
        # idea: need to store max_to_the_right
        result = deque()
        max_right_h = 0
        for i in reversed(range(len(heights))):
            if heights[i] > max_right_h:
                result.appendleft(i)
                max_right_h = heights[i]
        return result
```



## Solution 2: If your interviewer wants you to iterate from the left: stack/bfs

```python
class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Summary:
            There are `n` buildings in a line.
            The ocean is to the right of the buildings.
            A building has an ocean view if all the buildings 
            to its right have a smaller height.
        Args:
            heights - int array of size n that represents the heights of the building in the
            line. 
        Returns:
            a list of indices (0-indexed) that have an ocean view,
            sorted in increasing order.
        Examples:
            [4,2,3,1]
        """
        # make it a monotonically decreasing stack. only the remaining 
        # buildings have ocean view.
        stack = deque()
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            # if the building to the left is smaller, pop it.
            # 3, 2, 1, 4
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= heights[i]:
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(i)
        return stack
```

Idea: pop items from the stack if it can be blocked by the new building coming in.
