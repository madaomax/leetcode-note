# 973. K Closest Points to origin

Problem description [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/).

Tag of question: sort.

1. Python solution

```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        return sorted(points, key=lambda p: p[0] ** 2 + p[1] ** 2)[:k]
```

Note: `sorted()` in Python has `O(nlogn)` time complexity both on average and in worst case. Python uses [Timsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timsort). It is guaranteed to be stable.
