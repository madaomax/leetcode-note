# [31. Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/)

Medium - Hard if you haven't think about this kind of problem before

A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

- For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are all the permutations of `arr`: `[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]`.

The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

- For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
- Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
- While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.

Given an array of integers `nums`, *find the next permutation of* `nums`.

The replacement must be **[in place](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** and use only constant extra memory.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,5,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`



## Solution: Observe and find numbers...

Intuition: only if a number is smaller than a number to its right, it can be swapped. 
need to find the first pair of two successive a[i], a[i-1] from the right
that a[i] > a[i-1], s.t. we know that a[i-1] should be rearranged to the right.
Note that we only want the next larger number, so we want the number to a[i-1]'s right that is just larger than itself.

After swapping a[i-1], everything starting from a[i] should be reversed. Because note that every element after a[i] is in reverse order based on how we found a[i].

        A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members
        into a sequence or linear order.

        The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically
        greater permutation of its integer.
        If all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according
        to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is 
        the permutation that follows it in the sorted container.
        If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the
        lowest possible order.

        Must use only constant extra memory.
