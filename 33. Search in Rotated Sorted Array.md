# [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)

### Approach 1: Binary Search

O(logn) time complexity + search in an array => binary search.

Although the array is rotated, it retains some properties of sorted arrays that we can leverage. Specifically, one half of the array (either left or the right) will always be sorted. This means we can still apply binary search by determining which half of our array is sorted (wdym) and whether the target lies within it. 

If left half `[low...mid]` is sorted, we know this if the element at `low` is less than or equal to the element  at `mid`. In a normally sorted array, if the start if less than or equal to the midpoint, it means all the elements till the midpoint are in the correct increasing order.

- if the target lies within this sorted left half, we know this if the target is greater than or equal to the element at `low` and less than the element at `mid`. If this is the case, we then move our search to this half, meaning, we update `high` to `mid - 1`.
- Otherwise, the target must be in the right half. So, we update `low` to `mid + 1`.

If right half `[mid...high]` is sorted, this is the else part. If the left half isn't sorted, then right half must be. 

- If the target lies within this sorted right half, we know this if the target is greater than the element at `mid` and less than or equal to the element at `high`. If so, we move our search to this half by updating `low` to `mid + 1`. 
- Otherwise, the target must be in the left half. So, we update `high` to `mid - 1`.

        Summary:
            O(logn) time complexity
            Binary search: an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a
            sorted list. 

        Args:
            nums: int array sorted in ascending order, with distinct values.
            nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length)
        Returns:
            Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer `target`,
            return the index of target if it is in `nums`, or -1 if it is not in nums.
