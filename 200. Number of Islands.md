# [200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

#### Approach 1: DFS

When we see a graph problem, it is usually BFS or DFS. In this case, we want to count the number of islands, aka connected components. Therefore, we can use DFS. So we iterate through every element in`grid` and run DFS (`explore`) only on elements with value "1". After we finish traverse the DFS tree starting at a given element, all the visited elements should be marked as -1 and we add 1 to our `count`. 

The tweak to DFS we make in this problem is that we take advantage of `grid` to store the information for our visited elements. When we have visited a "1", we mark it as "-1" (of course, "0" also works). This saves us memory space. 

```Python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        """Graph problem huh, must be DFS, BFS
        Run DFS on the graph, turn visited elem from 1 -> 0. Count the connected components.
        """
        def explore(grid, m, n):
            """explore the island (dfs) that contains grid[m][n].
            Assume grid[m][n] == 1. """
            grid[m][n] = -1
            if m >= 1 and grid[m-1][n] == "1":
                explore(grid, m - 1, n)
            if n >= 1 and grid[m][n-1] == "1":
                explore(grid, m, n - 1)
            if m < len(grid) - 1 and grid[m+1][n] == "1":
                explore(grid, m + 1, n)
            if n < len(grid[0]) - 1 and grid[m][n+1] == "1":
                explore(grid, m, n + 1)

        m = len(grid)
        n = len(grid[0])
        count = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    explore(grid, i, j)
                    count += 1
        return count
```
