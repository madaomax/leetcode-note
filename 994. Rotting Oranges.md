# [994. Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/)

#### Approach: BFS with deque

Deque (Doubly Ended Queue) in Python is implemented using the module "collections". Deque is preferred over a list in the cases where we need quicker append and pop operations from both the ends of the container, as deque provides an O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations as compared to a list that provides O(n) time complexity. (list.pop(0) is O(n), list.pop() (last element) is O(1). Append is always O(1)).

Idea: Perform the operation as the problem described and count the minutes passed. Use BFS and only access the rotten oranges at current level.

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def orangesRotting(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        """Use BFS"""
        """
        Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has 
        a fresh orange
        visited rotten orange mark as 3
        """
        # check if grid is empty
        rows = len(grid)
        if rows == 0:
            return -1
        cols = len(grid[0])
        
        # keep track of fresh oranges
        fresh_cnt = 0

        # A queue with rotten oranges (for BFS)
        rotten = deque()

        # visit each cell in the grid
        for r in range(rows):
            for c in range(cols):
                if grid[r][c] == 2:
                    # add the rotten orange coordinates to the queue
                    rotten.append((r, c))
                elif grid[r][c] == 1:
                    # Update fresh oranges count

            # it is safe to update the minutes by 1,
            # since we visit oranges level by level in BFS traversal
            minutes_passed += 1

            # process rotten oranges on the *current level*
