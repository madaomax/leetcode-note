# [346. Moving Average from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/moving-average-from-data-stream/)

Easy

Array, Design, Queue, Data stream

# Solution 1: 

Just normal list / deque:

```py
class MovingAverage:

    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.size = size
        self.arr = deque(maxlen=size)

    def next(self, val: int) -> float:
        # Returns the moving average of the last
        # size values of the stream
        self.arr.append(val)
        return sum(self.arr) / len(self.arr)


# Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MovingAverage(size)
# param_1 = obj.next(val)

```

Time complexity O(1)

Space complexity O(N), N=window size



## Solution 2: optimizing on sum()

```python
class MovingAverage:

    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.size = size
        self.sum = 0
        self.arr = deque()

    def next(self, val: int) -> float:
        # Returns the moving average of the last
        # size values of the stream
        if len(self.arr) == self.size:
            self.sum -= self.arr.popleft()
        self.sum += val
        self.arr.append(val)
        return self.sum / len(self.arr)


# Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MovingAverage(size)
# param_1 = obj.next(val)
```

Note: python `len()` is very fast. It takes absolutely no time. So we did not keep track of a length variable to further increase speed.
